# GrabMyShow 

I revised the fundamentals of HTML, CSS (including box-sizing properties like margin and padding), Bootstrap grid layouts, 
and React basics, including import/export components and the map function method. 
Using this knowledge, I successfully built a ticket booking platform called "GrabMyShow!" ðŸŽ‰


### What I Learned and revisied:
HTML: Structured the clean and semantic markup for the web pages.

CSS: Applied styling properties, implemented box-sizing properties like margin and padding, and added hover effects for interactivity.

Bootstrap Grid Layouts: Utilized Bootstrap's grid system to create responsive and flexible layouts.

React Basics: Created and managed functional components, efficiently imported and exported components across files, and used the map function to dynamically generate event cards.

To demonstrate what Iâ€™ve learned, I cloned the Book My Show application! ðŸŽ¬ I applied these web development concepts to make the app more dynamic and efficient.
