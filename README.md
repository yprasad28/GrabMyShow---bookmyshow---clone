# GrabMyShow 

I revised the fundamentals of HTML, CSS (including box-sizing properties like margin and padding), Bootstrap grid layouts, 
and React basics, including import/export components and the map function method. 
Using this knowledge, I successfully built a ticket booking platform called "GrabMyShow!" ðŸŽ‰
